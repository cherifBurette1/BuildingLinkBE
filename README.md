## Features
The application includes the following features:
- Create a new driver
- Edit existing driver details
- Delete a driver
- Retrieve driver information
- Retrieve all drivers with sorted names
- Retrieve drivers with names sorted alphabetically

## Future Enhancements
Some potential enhancements for the application include:
- Adding authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the application.
- Enhancing error handling and logging for better troubleshooting and debugging (i.e: elmah).
- Improving performance by implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
- Adding additional features such as searching, filtering, and pagination for managing large datasets.
